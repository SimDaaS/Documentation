## Version 1.0
### Developer

## 1. Summary
Limulator Core is the library that handles the parsing and execution of OpenX standards. This is modules are precompiled and integrated with the LimulatorUE as a third-party library. It mainly consists of two parts: RoadManager and ScenarioEngine.

RoadManager is designed for OpenDrive 1.4 and works alongside the Limulator map, providing essential high-level information about the map.

ScenarioEngine parses OpenSCENARIO files and manages their execution. We use ScenarioEngine as a backend to run our OpenX simulations. The communication and integration are handled by the Scenario Handler OpenX, connecting with the Limulator Core and Limulator UE for smooth operation.
